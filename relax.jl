# * K-point (16x16x16 mesh -> 4096; ~ divided by two due to k=-k, plus gamma point)

# Docu says: The array shape for all grid-points (irreducible q-points) is (temperature, irreducible q-point, phonon band).
# So I guess that 1001 must be the temperature range. Don't know why things are reversed order.
